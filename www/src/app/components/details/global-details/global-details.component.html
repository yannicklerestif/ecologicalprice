<h2>Ecological Footprint</h2>
<p>Ecological prices are based on the work of the
  <a href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Global Footprint Network</a>.</p>
<p>Their work is based on the notion of <span class="emphasis">global hectare</span>, a unit in which they
  are able to express all resources we consume, and all available resources.</p>
<p>For CO2 emissions, it will be the amount of land needed to absorb them,
  for agricultural products, the land area needed to produce them,
  for livestock products, the land needed to feed them, and so on.</p>
<p>Different types of land account for a different number of global hectares depending on a coefficient
  they call <span class="emphasis">Equivalence Factor</span>.</p>
<p class="test">They calculated the world's total biocapacity as the following:</p>
<div class="data-box"><span class="emphasis">
  World's Total Biocapacity: {{worldTotalBiocapacity | number:'.2-2'}} billion gha
</span></div>

<h2>Pricing Global Hectares</h2>
<h3>Price in International Dollars</h3>
<p>To give an <span class="emphasis">ecological price</span> to a global hectare, we divide the amount of money spent in
  one year in the world by the world total biocapacity.</p>
<p>We can then compute the ecological price of an object by multiplying the number
  of global hectares needed to produce it by the ecological price of a global hectare.</p>
<p>To evaluate the amount of money spent in one year, the first idea that comes to mind is to use the world's GDP.</p>
<p>But the problem with this idea is that the ecological prices computed this way do not depend on the purchase power in
  a country. In other words, if the general level of the prices is a lot lower in a country, ecological prices in this
  country will be relatively a lot higher.</p>
<p>To take this into account, we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)">world's
  GDP expressed in International Dollars</a> as computed by the world bank, that takes the purchasing power parity into
  account. Its value is the following:</p>
<div class="data-box">
  <span class="emphasis">
    World's GDP in International Dollars: I${{worldPppGdp | number:'.2-2'}} billion
  </span>
</div>
<p>The price of a global hectare in International Dollars is then:</p>
<div class="data-box">
  <span class="emphasis">
    Ecological price of a global hectare:
  </span>
  {{worldPppGdp | number:'.2-2'}} / {{worldTotalBiocapacity | number:'.2-2'}} =
  <span class="emphasis">
    I${{globalHectarePriceIntDollars | number:'.2-2'}}
  </span>
</div>
<p>Because here the quantities we manipulate are typically a lot smaller than a hectare, we will use
  <span class="emphasis">global square meters</span>, that are 1 / {{10000 | number}} th of a global hectare.
  The ecological price of a global square meter is then:</p>
<div class="data-box data-box-result">
  <span class="emphasis">
    Ecological Price of a global square meter:
  </span>
  {{globalHectarePriceIntDollars | number:'.2-2'}} / {{10000 | number}} =
  <span class="emphasis">
    I${{globalSquareMeterPriceIntDollars | number:'.2-3'}}
  </span>
</div>

<h3>Price in {{selectedCurrency.name}} for {{selectedCountry.name}}</h3>
<p>The price of a global square meter for a country is the computed by multiplying the price
  in International Dollars
  by the average level of the prices in this country. We then convert it into the chosen currency.</p>
<p>Prices level in a country are computed by dividing the PPP GDP of this country by its nominal GDP.</p>
<div class="data-box">
  <span class="emphasis">
    Average price level in {{selectedCountry.name}}: {{selectedCountry.avgPrices | number:'.2-2'}}<br>
    Exchange rate for {{selectedCurrency.name}}: {{selectedCurrency.exchangeRate | number:'.2-2'}}<br>
  </span>
</div>
<p>Which gives us:</p>
<div class="data-box data-box-result">
  <span class="emphasis">
    Price of a global square meter in {{selectedCountry.name}}:
  </span>
  {{globalSquareMeterPriceIntDollars | number:'.2-3'}} x {{selectedCountry.avgPrices | number:'.2-2'}} x
  {{selectedCurrency.exchangeRate | number:'.2-2'}} =
  <span class="emphasis">
    <!-- FIXME:Â was: 3-3 -->
    {{globalSquareMeterPrice | ecologicalPrice:'.2-3'}}
  </span>
</div>
